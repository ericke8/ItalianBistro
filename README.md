Eric's Italian Bistro

A small webpage made as the start of my journey with React.  I explored Media components and Cards to display images with descriptions, and began using other React elements.
When started, it renders a menu of Italian dishes, and when a dish isclicked on, it displays a description as well as comments on the bottom of the page.
